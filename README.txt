FINAL HYBRID AR ENGINE (TESTED)

This build uses the GLOBAL MindAR image tracking build.
NO ES modules. NO CORS issues.

HOW TO USE:
1. Replace assets/target.mind with your image target
2. Replace assets/demo.mp4 with your video
3. Upload to HTTPS (GitHub Pages / Vercel)
4. Open on mobile browser

BEHAVIOR:
- Frame visible & stable → video follows frame
- Tracking weak → video freezes
- Frame lost → video fades out
